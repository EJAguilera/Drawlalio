# Drawlalio
Team Parka's Washington State University Crimson Code 2021 Hackathon submission.

Drawlalio is a primitive algorithm-driven social network, where users are presented with canvases which they can dismiss with a swipe, or modify and submit for future edits. Each canvas stores a chain of users that edited the canvas, illustrating the connection between each user and the art they've created.

## Staging Branch
This is the branch where changes are submitted to and cloned from before anything is merged into the main branch. If prototyping is needed, recommend creating own individual, personal branch for the changes until satisfactory. Then pull back into the staging branch.
