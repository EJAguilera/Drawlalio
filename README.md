# Drawlalio
Team Parka's Washington State University Crimson Code 2021 Hackathon submission.

Drawlalio is a primitive algorithm-driven social network, where users are presented with canvases which they can dismiss with a swipe, or modify and submit for future edits. Each canvas stores a chain of users that edited the canvas, illustrating the connection between each user and the art they've created.
